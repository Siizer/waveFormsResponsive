+# WaveForms Responsive
+
+This project provides an interactive waveform and phasor visualization tool. It can be previewed locally or via GitHub Pages.
+
+## Local Preview (Codex)
+
+1. Install Node.js (version 18 or later recommended).
+2. Install dependencies (none currently) and start the server:
+   ```bash
+   npm install
+   npm start
+   ```
+3. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
+
+## GitHub Pages
+
+The repository contains a static `index.html` at its root so it can be served directly by GitHub Pages. To enable Pages:
+
+1. In your repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the main branch.
+2. Visit the published site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository>`.
+
+All assets are relative, so the same files work both locally and on GitHub Pages.
